What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initialize a repository, a file named .git is created at once. In my opinion, each repository should has its own feature and messages which make difference with others and are also the need for controling and menagering themselves.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the temporary area for storing the files that you work on in the working directory and then you want to commit to the repository.
It might offer the file-relative information.
