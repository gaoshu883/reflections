What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initialize a repository, a file named .git is created at once. In my opinion, each repository should has its own feature and messages which make difference with others and are also the need for controling and menagering themselves.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the temporary area for storing the files that you work on in the working directory and then you want to commit to the repository.
It might offer the file-relative information. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
The command git diff --staged will help us view the difference between the staging area and the most recent commit, so we can find each logical change we have made.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Sometimes, if we want to try out a new experimental features that we're still not sure will work, but we still want to have a working demo to show our friends when they ask what we're working on. Or we want to make a version of another langurage.
Branches will protect the real official version from affected by the experimental one, and each branch can stretch forward independently.
